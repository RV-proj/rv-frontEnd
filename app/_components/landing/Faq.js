      question: "What is RVEEDOM Flex+?",
      answer:
        "Flex+ is our premium matching service. You pick the RV type and dates, and we instantly notify top-rated local owners. The first qualified owner to accept wins the job—meaning you get a same-type or higher upgrade at a competitive Flex+ rate with pro delivery, setup and support included.",
    },

      id: 2,
      question: "How much can I save?",
      answer:
        "Typical Flex+ bookings come in 8–18% under comparable listings thanks to dynamic owner competition and our streamlined operations. Savings vary by season, location and length of stay.",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What if no owner accepts?",
      answer:
        "We expand the search radius and tiers. If we can’t confirm a match within your chosen window, we’ll present alternatives or issue a fast refund—your choice.",
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "Is delivery required?",
      answer:
        "Most Flex+ trips include white-glove delivery and full setup at your campsite, home, or event venue. Driveables and self-pickup options are also available in select markets.",
    },

      id: 5,
      question: "Do you work with insurance/FEMA?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We support insurance-covered and FEMA-supported long-term stays. Our team can coordinate documentation, billing, and extensions to keep families comfortably housed.",
